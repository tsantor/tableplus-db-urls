## Overview

Generate TablePlus DB URLs from CookieCutter Django to make setting up connections easier. Yea, I'm that lazy!

It assumes you are using [django-cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django) with the `use_docker=y` option and that you are connecting to your Postgres DB over SSH using your private key (`~/.ssh/config`) in production.

It is looking for your `.postgres` env files that are generated by cookiecutter at

## Installation

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install tableplus-db-urls
```

## Usage

```bash
# --path should be your django project root
$ tableplus --path="." --ssh-user="user" --ssh-host="xxx.xxx.x.x"
```

Then in TablePlus, on the main screen, right-click and choose `New` > `Connection from URL...` and use the URLs provided by the output.

## Development

```bash
make env
make pip_install
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

## Testing

```bash
make pytest
make coverage
make open_coverage
```
